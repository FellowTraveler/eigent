Eigent Open Source License
This project employs a User-Segmented Dual Licensing model.

Core principle – user‑segmented dual licensing

Individuals and teams with 10 or fewer users: You may use the Software under the Apache License 2.0 with the additional Branding and Attribution clause described below.
Teams with more than 10 users: You must obtain a Commercial License from Eigent AI Ltd. before using the Software.

Definitions
User count (≤10 users) – For the purposes of this license, “10 users or fewer” means that no more than ten (10) individuals can access, use, or in any way directly or indirectly benefit from your deployment of the Software. This includes, but is not limited to, developers, testers, operations, end-users, and indirect users via integrated systems.
Branding and Attribution – You must not remove, hide, or alter the Eigent name, logos, or copyright notices displayed in the Eigent user interface (including desktop applications and web consoles).This restriction is inapplicable to uses of Eigent that do not involve its frontend.
Frontend Definition: For the purposes of this license, the "frontend" of Eigent includes all components located in the electron/ directory when running Eigent from the raw source code, or the "electron" image when running Eigent with Docker.

1. Open Source License – for individuals and teams with 10 or fewer users
Subject to the user‑count and branding requirements above, the Software is licensed to you under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. In short, this grants you the right to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, display, perform and distribute the Software.
A Commercial License (see below) is also required if you wish to avoid the obligations of the Apache License 2.0 or if you wish to remove or alter Eigent branding.
Please read and understand the full terms of the Apache License 2.0 carefully before use.

2. Commercial License – for teams with more than 10 users or branding changes
If your organization has more than ten (10) individuals who will access, use, or benefit from the Software, you must obtain and execute a Commercial License from Eigent AI Ltd.
Even if you qualify under the "10 or fewer users" definition above, if your intended use case cannot comply with the terms of the Apache License 2.0, or if you require specific commercial terms not offered by the Apache License 2.0, or if you wish to remove or modify Eigent’s branding, you also must contact us to obtain and execute a Commercial License.
The Commercial License will grant rights beyond those provided by the Apache License 2.0, including (but not limited to) the ability to rebrand the Software and the possibility of additional warranties, indemnities or support.
To enquire about a Commercial License please email info@eigent.ai.

4. Other terms
Apart from the specific conditions mentioned above, all other rights and restrictions follow the Apache License 2.0. Detailed information about the Apache License 2.0 can be found at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.
The interactive design of the Software, as well as Eigent’s names and logos, are protected by intellectual property laws.
